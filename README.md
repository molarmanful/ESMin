# 𝔼𝕊𝕄𝕚𝕟
𝔼𝕊𝕄𝕚𝕟 is a stack-based code-golfing language based on ES6. It aims to change the syntax so that most ES6 char combinations can be written with one char.

Included is a parser, written in ES6 for Firefox. Language documentation will be added to the wiki; you can also look at `interpreter.js` for an idea of the syntax.
