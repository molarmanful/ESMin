# 𝔼𝕊𝕄𝕚𝕟
𝔼𝕊𝕄𝕚𝕟 is a hybrid code-golfing language based on ES6. It aims to change the syntax so that most ES6 char combinations can be written with one char.

Included is an interpreter, written in ES6 for Firefox, and a single-byte encoding map for Mines (𝔼𝕊𝕄𝕚𝕟's custom encoding). Language documentation will be added to the wiki; you can also look at `interpreter.js` for an idea of the syntax.
